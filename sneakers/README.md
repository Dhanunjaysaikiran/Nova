## Overview
This is a static E-comerce web page of a product which is responsive for all kinds of devices having different widths.

### The challenge

The development of this website is a quiet challenging for me, having no work experience and while building this site I have got to learn so many new things & concepts during this project.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript
- Fluid typography

*

### What I learned

I have learnt how to manipulate the DOM CSS using javascript, and explored the z-index property of CSS
### Continued development

I atill want to work on the DOM manipulation which is where I got so stuck for hours and I still want to work on fluid typography which is the best thing in CSS and also alot of fun thing to work on.
