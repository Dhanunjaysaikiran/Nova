## Overview
This is a basic landing web page of Sunnyside. Which is completely responsive in all kind of devices containing different resolutions.

### The challenge

The development of this website is a quiet challenging for me, having no work experience and while building this site I have got to learn so many new things & concepts during this project.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript
- Fluid typography

*

### What I learned

Since I am a beginner, this is my first ever project which had me face so many challenges but thankfully I also got to learn so many new concepts like , fluid-typography (Adjusting font size without using media query using calc() function) and I also learned how to manipulate CSS dom using javascript. 
### Continued development

I atill wants to work on the DOM manipulation which is where I got so stuck for hours and I still wants to work on fluid typography which is the best thing in CSS and also alot of fun thing to work on.
